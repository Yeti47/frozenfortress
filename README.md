# Run the web server
./run-webui.sh

# Or run directly
./bin/ffwebui
```

The web interface will be available at `http://localhost:8080` (or your configured port).

#### CLI Administration
```bash
# View available commands
./bin/ffcli --help

# User management
./bin/ffcli user create <username> <password>
./bin/ffcli user activate <username>
./bin/ffcli user list
./bin/ffcli user lock <username>
./bin/ffcli user unlock <username>

# Backup management
./bin/ffcli backup create
./bin/ffcli backup list
./bin/ffcli backup cleanup

# Secret management
./bin/ffcli secret create <name> <value>
./bin/ffcli secret list
```

## üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Web User Interface (WebUI)

The WebUI provides a modern, intuitive interface for end-users to manage their secrets and documents. It's designed for daily use and includes all the features needed for personal data management.

### Key Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login with session management
- **Secret Management**: Create, edit, view, and organize secrets
- **Document Management**: Upload, view, and manage documents with OCR support
- **Search & Filter**: Advanced search capabilities across secrets and documents
- **Tag System**: Organize content with customizable tags
- **Account Management**: User profile and account settings
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

### Available Views
- **Login/Registration**: User authentication and account creation
- **Secrets**: Manage passwords, API keys, and other sensitive information (main view after login)
- **Documents**: Upload, view, and manage documents with OCR text extraction
- **Tags**: Organize and manage tags for better content organization
- **Account Settings**: User profile management and security settings
- **Recovery**: Account recovery functionality

### User Workflow
Frozen Fortress follows a secure user registration and activation workflow:

1. **User Registration**: New users can request access through the WebUI registration form
2. **Admin Activation**: An administrator with server access uses the CLI to activate the new user account
3. **User Login**: Once activated, users can log in and start using the application

Alternatively, administrators can create users directly via the CLI without requiring web registration.

## üåê Deployment & Security Considerations

Frozen Fortress is specifically designed for **local self-hosting** environments. The application architecture prioritizes simplicity and ease of deployment while maintaining security best practices.

### Network Security
- **HTTP by Design**: The Go application runs on plain HTTP and does not include built-in HTTPS support
- **Reverse Proxy Architecture**: The application is intended to be deployed behind a reverse proxy (such as **nginx**) that handles HTTPS termination
- **Local Network Focus**: Designed primarily for local network deployment rather than direct internet exposure

### Recommended Deployment Setup
```
Local Network ‚Üí nginx (HTTPS) ‚Üí Frozen Fortress WebUI (HTTP)
```

### Example nginx Configuration
```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name your-domain.com;
    
    ssl_certificate /path/to/your/certificate.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/your/private.key;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

### Security Best Practices
- **Use HTTPS**: Always deploy with HTTPS in production via reverse proxy
- **Firewall Rules**: Configure firewall to restrict access to the Go application port (default 8080)
- **Local Network**: Consider restricting access to local network ranges
- **Regular Updates**: Keep nginx and SSL certificates up to date

## üñ≤Ô∏è Command Line Interface (CLI)

The CLI is designed for system administrators and provides comprehensive user management, backup operations, and system maintenance capabilities. It requires direct server access and operates with elevated privileges.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security & Access Control

**Important:** The CLI application is intended for **privileged administrators only** and should be treated as a high-privilege system tool.

- **Administrative Access**: CLI users are assumed to be system administrators with privileged access to the host system
- **No Authentication for Admin Tasks**: Administrative operations (user management, backups, configuration) do not require authentication
- **Authentication Required for User Data**: Operations involving encrypted user data require user password authentication
- **Direct Database Access**: CLI operations bypass web-based security controls and operate directly on the database
- **Elevated Privileges**: CLI users can create, modify, delete, and manage all user accounts and system data

### üîê Encryption Boundaries

**Critical:** Even with CLI administrative access, **encrypted user data remains protected** by user-specific encryption.

- **Encrypted Data Protection**: Administrators cannot access encrypted secrets, documents, or sensitive user data
- **User Password Required**: Any operations involving encryption/decryption require authentication with the user's password
- **Master Encryption Keys (MEK)**: User-specific encryption keys are derived from user passwords and cannot be bypassed
- **Admin Limitations**: CLI admins can manage user accounts but cannot decrypt or access user's encrypted content
- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: The system is designed so that even administrators cannot access user data without explicit user authentication

**Example:** An admin can activate/deactivate a user account, but cannot read that user's encrypted passwords or documents.

### Access Restrictions
- **File System Permissions**: Ensure CLI binary has appropriate file system permissions (e.g., executable only by admin users)
- **Server Access**: CLI should only be accessible to users with SSH/console access to the server
- **Network Isolation**: CLI does not expose network interfaces and requires local system access
- **Audit Trail**: Consider logging CLI usage for security auditing purposes

### Available Commands

#### User Management (`ffcli user`)
- `create <username> <password>` - Create a new user account
- `activate <username>` - Activate a user account (enables login)
- `deactivate <username>` - Deactivate a user account (disables login)
- `lock <username>` - Lock a user account (temporary suspension)
- `unlock <username>` - Unlock a locked user account
- `list` - List all user accounts with their status
- `delete <username>` - Permanently delete a user account

#### Secret Management (`ffcli secret`)
- `create <name> <value>` - Create a new secret
- `list` - List all secrets
- `delete <name>` - Delete a secret

#### Backup Management (`ffcli backup`)
- `create` - Create a manual backup of the database
- `list` - List all available backups
- `cleanup` - Remove old backups according to retention policy
- `delete <backup-id>` - Delete a specific backup

#### System Configuration (`ffcli setup`)
- `setup` - Interactive configuration wizard
- `setup --read` - Display current configuration values
